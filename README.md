## Impact
With this, Radio Indigo became one of the first radio stations in the country to provide Radio As A Service (RAAS) at international airports. The new coverage reach turned out to be in millions (based on the circulation of the newspapers/magazines/websites) and this project was highly regarded as one of the best campaigns in the region.
